<!-- âœ… 1. What is Global State Management?
ðŸ§  Definition:
Global state management is the technique of sharing and managing state (data) across multiple components in a React app from a central place, instead of passing data via props manually through many layers.
ðŸ’¡ Why itâ€™s needed:
When your app gets bigger, some data (like user info, auth status, cart items, theme, etc.) needs to be accessed/updated by many components â€” not just parent/child. Global state management avoids prop drilling and helps with better organization.
ðŸ§¾ Example use cases:
Logged-in user info
Theme mode (dark/light)
Shopping cart items
Notification system
AI prediction results shared across pages -->

<!-- âœ… 2. What is a Promise-based HTTP client?
ðŸ§  Definition:
An HTTP client lets you send requests to servers (APIs). If itâ€™s "promise-based", it means it uses JavaScript Promises to handle asynchronous operations (like API calls). -->

# 1. Axios ðŸ“¡

# Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

# âœ… Why use Axios?

# Easier and cleaner syntax than fetch

# Supports interceptors, automatic JSON parsing, request cancellation, and more

# Works in both the browser and Node.js

# 2. Zustand ðŸ§ 

# Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React.

# âœ… Why use Zustand?

# Simpler and more intuitive than Redux or Context API

# Lightweight (just a few KB)

# No boilerplate â€” just pure JavaScript functions

# Ideal for both global and local state in React apps
